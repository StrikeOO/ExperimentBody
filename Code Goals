Staircase method is going to need to be able to adjust presentation stimuli.

Present a plus in the middle of the screen that never goes away

Fixation
  Use eye tracker.  Don't start trial until subject has foveated on plus sign for 1000 ms
  Start trial
  If at any point in the subject saccades outside of the center, record the trial as "fail"

Present a cue
  1/3 of the time, present a neutral cue
  2/3 of the time, present a cue in one direction
  Randomize which direction the cue is
  
ISI

Present stimuli
  same location every time
  variables we're adjusting are size and location of gap
  gap can be top or bottom
  size is going to be adjusted by the staircase method
  (Might be a good idea to read a paper about staircase method how to????)
  
 ISI
 
Response cue
  70% of the 2/3 of the remaining time, present a valid response cue
  30% of the 2/3 of the remaining time, present an invalid response cue
  
Record response
  use left and write keys to record response
  if correct, adjust stimulus accordingly
  if incorrect, adjust stimulus accordingly
  record trial type
  record result (correct or incorrect)
  record reaction time
  record difficulty
